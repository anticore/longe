>An animated flyer, made for the audiovisual live performance "Echo Chamber Effect", that happened on december 3rd @ inercia demoparty.
"Echo Chamber Effect" is a project that gathers digital art researchers and the portuguese demoscene, and is founded in the convergence and remixing of a set of previous and original works by the group. This performance unites the digital with the analog and the pre-recorded with the immediate, through music and reproduction of realtime graphics and livecoding.
