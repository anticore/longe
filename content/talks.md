> This is a recording from our December 2023 cables.gl meetup, where our dear friend and cables user anticore talks about his journey in creating the demo "Ninja de Gaia”, which secured third place at the Inércia 2023 demo party in Portugal. Watch anticore explain how he used cables.gl to create visually striking scenes, also diving into some of the practical aspects of demo creation, such as asset management, scene building, and the efficient use of resources to optimize performance.

> Cables.gl is a tool for creating beautiful interactive content. With an easy to navigate interface and real time visuals, it allows for rapid prototyping and fast adjustments. Anticore and liqube will make this presentation framed from the perspective of Gaia Space Agency demos, with focus on techniques, learned lessons and nifty tricks.
