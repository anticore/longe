A list of ideas I'm interested in exploring in the future.

ðŸ’¡ **Shader portfolio/notebook**: A tool that serves both as a shader development enviroment and an UI to publish and browse them easily;

ðŸ’¡ **Random Android/iPhone apps list**: A tool to promote discoverability of unknown mobile apps, generates a completely random or filtered list of random applications from the stores. More of a gimmick than an interesting project;

ðŸ’¡ **[vdo.ninja](https://vdo.ninja) integration with [cables.gl](https://cables.gl)**:  Currently there's no easy/free way to pass video between two cables patches or to receive a video stream from within a cables patch. 
An integration with vdo.ninja or another WebRTC technology could prove very useful for video art projects;

ðŸ’¡ **AI as a non-intrusive art tool**: Find ways to apply AI models as postprocessing sugar, or other ways to inroduce these powerful tools into the creative workflow, without the agent replacing the artist.
