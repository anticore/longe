My name is João Faria and I work as a software developer and creative technologist.
Based in Porto, Portugal. 
I'm currently employed as a Frontend Developer at [Blip](https://www.blip.pt/), working on internal tools for [FanDuel](https://fanduel.com).
In my free time I enjoy exploring ways to create art in different mediums, whether it is [[audio]], [[visual]], [[demoscene|code]], [[photography]]...
